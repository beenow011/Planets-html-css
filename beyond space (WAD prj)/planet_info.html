                <div class="mer_content">
                    <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. It is the smallest planet in the Solar System, reaching
                        only 4879.4 km or 3031.9 miles in diameter. It is so small that it is smaller than Saturn's moon
                        Titan and Jupiter's moon Ganymede.

                        Even though Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, it is not the hottest (which the title
                        belongs to Venus) but that doesn't mean its temperature is bland. A day on Mercury is 430
                        degrees Celsius in temperature and a night on Mercury can freeze at a temperature of -180
                        degrees Celsius. Why does Mercury have an extremely large temperature range? That's because of
                        its atmosphere. Mercury's atmosphere is so thin that it's barely a metric ton dense. The very
                        thin atmosphere allows most of the space radiation, heat, and coldness from the Sun to arrive at
                        the surface. </p>

                <div class="ven_content">
                    <p>Venus is the second closest planet to the Sun. It is referred to as Earth's sister planet due to
                        its similar structure, size and mass.

                        Although Venus is not the closest planet to the Sun (in which the title goes to Mercury), it is
                        in fact the hottest. That's because Venus has a thick and dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide and
                        sulphuric acid. Under the atmosphere, the temperature rises up to 475 degrees Celsius, and the
                        pressure is equal to 92 bars (That's the pressure of 1 km depth into the ocean on Earth).

                        The chemicals inside Venus's clouds (like acidic crystal and sulphuric acid .etc) are capable of
                        reflecting light efficiently. This allows Venus to reflect back most of the light from the Sun
                        it receives. This is also the reason Venus looks so bright in the night sky (The second
                        brightest object after the Moon). </p>

                    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun. It is the only planet known to support life nowadays.
                        Liquid water makes up 71% of Earth's entire surface, and only 29% is solid land. Earth is the
                        largest terrestrial planet and is the fifth largest planet, with the fifth largest natural
                        satellite. It is home to a sapient race of organisms referred to as Modern Humans, or Homo
                        Sapiens scientifically. They have a population of about 8,010,374,000 and is currently causing
                        an ongoing period of geographic mass extinction on Earth. </p>

                    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. Mars has been discovered and observed since ancient
                        times, like since 5000 BCE. It is referred to as the "Red Planet" because of its reddish hue
                        that is given by the rust of iron oxide in its surface.

                        Mars is the most similar planet to Earth, because it has water glaciers on its poles and orbits
                        in the outer edge of the habitable zone. Mars has two asteroid-like natural satellites: Phobos
                        and Deimos. Phobos is the bigger one between the both of them. </p>

                <div class="mer_content">
                    <p>Jupiter is the 5th closest planet to the Sun, and is also the largest planet. It is so big that
                        up to 1300 earths can fit inside of it.

                        Jupiter's atmospheric composition is made of the same elements as the Sun, hydrogen and helium.
                        However, unlike the Sun, Jupiter does not have enough gravity and mass to begin nuclear fusion
                        and become a star. But Jupiter is at the very edge of becoming a Brown Dwarf Star, as it is
                        denser that the largest exoplanet in the Milky Way.

                        Season on Jupiter are not very extreme because of its tilt. It takes nearly 12 years to complete
                        its orbit but what is interesting is that it is the fastest rotating planet n the solar system
                        because it takes only 10 hours to complete one rotation. </p>

                        along with having the most moons. Saturn is most famous for its complex ring system, which are

                    <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Uranus was the first planet to be discovered by a
                        telescope, and is famous for rotating completely on its side. Its biggest moon is Titania.
                        Uranus formed in the outer edges of the Solar Nebula and didn't form from a rocky clump core
                        (unlike the other planets) because of its distance from the Sun, only leaving it a gaseous
                        planet (Also an ice giant).

                        Uranus was the furthest planet from the Sun until 4.5 billion years ago when Jupiter and
                        Saturn's gravity distorted the orbit of Neptune and Pluto, propelling them back much further
                        than Uranus. </p>

                    <p>Neptune is the eighth and furthest planet from the Sun. Neptune is an ice giant like Uranus but
                        with a darker tint of blue. Neptune was discovered September 23, 1846 by 3 astronomers: John
                        Couch Adams, Urbain Le Verrier, and Johann Galle. Neptune has fourteen known satellites. Its
                        biggest moon is Triton.

                        Neptune is famous for having the fastest wind currents in the Solar System, speeding up at a
                        velocity of 1200 miles per hour. Neptune has 120 trillion pieces of ice discovered on October
                        18, 1996. </p>
